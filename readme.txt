A basic waiting/landing page plugin for Wordpress


== Description ==
When you develop or modify a website you sometimes want to hide the content from visitors while redirecting them to a temporary page. That's exactly what this plugin does.

* __Multilingual ready__: This plugin is currently only available in english. It's however multilingual ready. 
* __IP white listing__: to let devs, testers & clients access the website during its development (this is not a secured/reliable method to hide content but good enough if your content is not top secret).
* __Posts, Custom Posts & Pages white listing__: For callback pages and other pages you may not want to hide.
* __Redirect to homepage__: If for any reason people try to access your landing page after you disabled it they will be redirected to the homepage (this behavior can be disabled).

== Installation ==
1. [Install & activate](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins) the plugin 
2. [Create a Wordpress Page](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Pages) that will be used as your landing page.
3. In the Wordpress administration go to Settings > W8ing
